# Chat Components Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all chat-related React components.

## Structure

- `core/` - Core chat components (ChatWindow, MessageList, etc.)
- `features/` - Feature-specific components (BusinessHours, Eligibility)
- `shared/` - Shared/reusable components (LoadingStates, ErrorBoundary)

## Component Documentation Template

Each component should be documented with:

1. Purpose and usage
2. Props interface
3. Example usage
4. Storybook stories (if applicable)
5. Test coverage requirements
6. Accessibility considerations

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Document all props with TypeScript interfaces
- Include accessibility (a11y) considerations
- Add unit tests for all components
- Create Storybook stories for visual testing
